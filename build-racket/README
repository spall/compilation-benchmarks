makebase_bench.sh version MAX_cpu interval path-to-makefile-directory

Runs 'make base' in 'path-to-make-file-directory' with 1 to 'MAX_cpu' increasing the
number of cpu's by 'interval'.

Results are written to a 'base_version_timestamp.out' file in a results directory
created where script is run from.

THIS SCRIPT ISNT BEING USED ATM

=====================================================================================

make_bench.sh version machine MAX_cpu interval path-to-makefile-directory

Runs 'make' in 'path-to-make-file-directory' with 1 cpu, then 'interval' cpus, to 'MAX_cpu' 
increasing the number of cpu's by 'interval'.

Version and machine are used along with a timestamp to create a file in the 'results'
directory that contains the timing output.

Output from each run of make is put into a file 'output_version_machine_timestamp_cpu.out'.


This script contains 'git clean -fxd' to delete everything that isn't commited in the git
repository.  This is to make sure a full build is done every time.  As a result this script
only works with git projects (although I guess even if that command fails bash will continue
and run make in whatever directory).

======================================================================================

make_bench_every_rule.sh version machien max_cpu interval path-to-makefile-directory

Works the same as above except it uses a special shell to time each shell command
launched by make.  The output of this is written to 'results/prints_version_machine_timestamp_cpu.out'
