driver.rkt [-d] (-r | -n) <file>

-d or --dotfile produces a dotfile from the tree produced from <file>

-r or --rusage-data
-n or --dry-run-output

One of the above must be supplied, it tells the program how to parse <file>.

-n or --dry-run-output says <file> was produced by running 'make -nd' and so the
tree that is created will not contain any rusage data.

-r or --rusage-data says <file> was produced by running make with the rusage shell
as well as 'make --debu=v ...' which tells make to print additional debug information.
This will produce a tree that includes any rusage data parsed from the file.
